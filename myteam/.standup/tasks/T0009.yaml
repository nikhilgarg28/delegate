title: Separate sender/recipient chat filters + include director
description: 'Current chat filter is a single ''All participants'' dropdown that filters
  on sender OR recipient. Director (nikhil) is excluded because /agents endpoint skips
  role=director. Changes needed: 1) Replace single dropdown with two: ''From'' (sender)
  and ''To'' (recipient) dropdowns. 2) Include the director name in filter dropdown
  options (either hardcode ''nikhil'' or add a /participants endpoint, or populate
  from unique senders/recipients in messages). 3) Update client-side filtering: if
  From is set, filter m.sender===from; if To is set, filter m.recipient===to; both
  can be set simultaneously. Key file: scripts/web.py lines 288-293 (filter HTML),
  lines 380-414 (loadChat JS). Keep same visual style as current filters.'

title: Add lifetime messages sent/received to agent stats
description: 'Add sent and received message counts to the agent stats card. Query
  the messages table: COUNT where sender=agent (sent) and COUNT where recipient=agent
  (received). Either add to the existing /agents/{name}/stats endpoint or compute
  client-side from /messages data. Display in the expanded agent card alongside existing
  stats. Key files: scripts/web.py (frontend), scripts/chat.py (backend query if adding
  to endpoint).'

title: Expandable agent cards with stats
description: 'Click an agent card to expand inline and show stats: tasks completed,
  tasks reviewed, total tokens (in/out), total cost USD, average time per task. Needs:
  (1) New /agents/{name}/stats API endpoint in web.py that aggregates from tasks (count
  done where assignee=name, count done where reviewer=name) and sessions (sum tokens,
  sum cost, avg duration). (2) Frontend: click agent card to toggle expanded section
  below with stats grid. Click again or click another to collapse. Match the expandable
  row pattern being built for tasks. Key files: scripts/web.py (endpoint + frontend),
  scripts/chat.py (session queries).'

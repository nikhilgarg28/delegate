title: Simulated director for eval runs
description: "Create a simulated director that answers manager questions during eval\
  \ runs, removing the need for a human in the loop.\n\nThe sim-director:\n- Watches\
  \ the director's inbox for messages from the manager\n- Responds via the director's\
  \ outbox using the existing mailbox system\n- Answers strictly based on the benchmark\
  \ task spec (no volunteering extra info)\n- Uses a standardized prompt template:\
  \ 'You are a director. Here is the task spec: {spec}. Answer the manager's question\
  \ based only on this spec. Be concise.'\n\nImplementation options (pick the simpler\
  \ one):\nA. Use claude-code-sdk (already a dependency) to call Claude with the sim-director\
  \ prompt\nB. Use the Anthropic API directly via httpx (already a dev dependency)\n\
  \nPut this in scripts/sim_director.py (separate module since it has its own event\
  \ loop):\n- sim_director_respond(root, task_spec, message) -> str \u2014 given a\
  \ message, return the sim-director's response\n- run_sim_director(root, task_specs,\
  \ poll_interval=2.0) \u2014 poll director inbox, match messages to task specs, respond,\
  \ loop until stopped\n\nThe task_specs param is a dict of {task_title: task_description}\
  \ loaded from benchmark YAML files.\n\nAdd basic tests in tests/test_sim_director.py\
  \ (mock the LLM call, test the inbox polling + response routing logic).\n\nCode\
  \ lives in /Users/nikhil/dev/standup/. Study scripts/agent.py and scripts/router.py\
  \ for patterns on polling inboxes and sending messages.\nMessage edison when done."

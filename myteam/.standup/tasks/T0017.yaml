title: 'Expandable task rows: collapsed summary + expanded detail card'
description: "Redesign the Tasks table with expandable rows. Collapsed row (5 columns):\
  \ ID, Title, Status, Assignee, Priority. Click to expand inline into a detail card\
  \ showing: Reviewer, Project, Time, Tokens (in/out), Cost, Description, Created/Completed\
  \ dates. Click again or click another row to collapse. Smooth CSS transition (max-height\
  \ or similar). The expanded card should use a subtle background and border to distinguish\
  \ from the table. Filters (T0012) should remain above the table. Key file: scripts/web.py\
  \ \u2014 rewrite loadTasks() and add CSS for expanded state. Depends on T0016 (reviewer\
  \ field) being available."

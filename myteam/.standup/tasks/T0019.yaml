title: "Fix agent card flicker on expand \u2014 preserve state across auto-refresh"
description: "The 2-second setInterval calls loadAgents() which rebuilds innerHTML,\
  \ collapsing any expanded card and causing flicker. Fix: track which agent card\
  \ is expanded (e.g. a global variable like expandedAgent), and after rebuilding\
  \ the DOM in loadAgents(), re-expand that card. Or better: diff the data and only\
  \ update changed elements instead of replacing innerHTML. Simplest approach: store\
  \ expandedAgent name, rebuild HTML, then re-trigger expand on that card. Key file:\
  \ scripts/web.py \u2014 loadAgents() function and the setInterval block around line\
  \ 441-446."

title: 'Visual refresh: Geist font and improved aesthetics'
description: "Upgrade the UI typography and overall aesthetics to feel more modern/Vercel-like.\
  \ Scope:\n\n1. **Font**: Switch from system font stack to Geist Sans (Vercel font).\
  \ Load via Google Fonts CDN or the Vercel font CDN. Add a <link> tag in the <head>\
  \ of the HTML_PAGE. Update the body font-family to: \"Geist Sans\", \"Inter\", -apple-system,\
  \ BlinkMacSystemFont, sans-serif (with fallback chain).\n\n2. **Typography refinement**:\
  \ Adjust font sizes, weights, line-heights, and letter-spacing across the UI for\
  \ better readability and polish. Chat messages especially need attention \u2014\
  \ the director called out the chat font specifically.\n\n3. **Color refresh**: The\
  \ current palette is functional but flat. Improve the color scheme to feel more\
  \ polished \u2014 consider:\n   - Slightly warmer or more vibrant background tones\n\
  \   - Better contrast ratios for readability\n   - More refined border/divider colors\n\
  \   - Subtle hover/focus states\n   - Consider a subtle gradient or accent treatment\
  \ for the header\n\n4. **Overall polish**: Improve spacing, padding, border-radius,\
  \ and any other visual details that make the difference between \"functional\" and\
  \ \"refined\". Look at Linear, Vercel, or similar modern dark-mode dashboards for\
  \ inspiration.\n\nKey file: scripts/web.py \u2014 all CSS is inline in HTML_PAGE\
  \ (lines 199-240), plus the HTML structure (lines 242-260). This is a single-file\
  \ change."

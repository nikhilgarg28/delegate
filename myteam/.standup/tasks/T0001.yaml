title: Show tokens, time, and USD cost per task in Tasks table
description: 'The backend already has /tasks/{id}/stats endpoint returning elapsed_seconds,
  agent_time_seconds, total_tokens_in, total_tokens_out, total_cost_usd. The frontend
  Tasks table (in web.py HTML_PAGE) needs to: 1) Fetch stats for each task via the
  stats endpoint, 2) Add columns for Time, Tokens, and Cost to the task table, 3)
  Format nicely (e.g. time as Xm Ys, tokens as comma-separated numbers, cost as $X.XX).
  Only show stats for tasks that are in_progress or done (per director request). Key
  file: scripts/web.py lines 277-291 (loadTasks function) and line 282 (table headers).'

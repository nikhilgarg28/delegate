MERGED — T0037. Excellent work on the diff panel. The unified diff parser, syntax-highlighted rendering, file list with +/-N badges, slide-out animation, Escape key, and responsive breakpoint all match spec precisely. View Diff button integration in task rows is a nice touch. 274 tests pass.

This unblocks T0038 (alice's wiring task) and the agent detail panel. Thanks for picking this up and delivering quickly.

Stand by for your next task.

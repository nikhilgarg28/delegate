New task: T0041 — Add agent inbox, outbox, and logs API endpoints.

This is the backend for the new unified right-side agent detail panel that nikhil approved. Three new GET endpoints:
- /agents/{name}/inbox — all messages received, with read/unread status
- /agents/{name}/outbox — all messages sent, with routed/pending status
- /agents/{name}/logs — worklog markdown files from .standup/team/{name}/logs/

Full spec in the task description. All changes in scripts/web.py (the API layer). Branch: bob/standup-ui/041-agent-detail-apis. Message me when done.

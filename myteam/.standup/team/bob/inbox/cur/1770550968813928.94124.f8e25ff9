REVIEW_RESPONSE for T0017: Approved. Excellent redesign — the expandable card pattern is consistent with agent cards, smooth CSS max-height transitions, efficient stats fetching only for expanded rows, proper state persistence with _expandedTasks Set and _taskStatsCache. Detail grid is well-organized with all 8 fields. stopPropagation on detail div prevents collapse when interacting. All 176 tests pass.

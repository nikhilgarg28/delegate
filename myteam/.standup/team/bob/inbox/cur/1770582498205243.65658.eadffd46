**T0038: Wire up diff panel to task details**

Note: In T0037 you already added a 'View Diff' button to the task row. T0038 is about enhancing the task detail view with:
1. Branch name display in task details (from task.branch field)
2. Clickable commit SHA pills (from task.commits array)
3. Ensure the 'View Diff' button is wired correctly with openDiffPanel()
4. event.stopPropagation() on interactive elements inside expanded task rows

Check the task.py schema — tasks have 'branch' and 'commits' fields (added in T0036).

Branch: bob/standup-ui/038-wire-diff-panel
Base off: main (commit cf67876) — this is the new consolidated main branch with all recent merges.
Code lives in /Users/nikhil/dev/standup/.
Message edison when done.

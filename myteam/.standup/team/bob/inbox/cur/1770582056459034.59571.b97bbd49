New task T0048 — Re-incorporate notification sounds from orphaned T0039. HIGH priority.

During T0043 review I discovered that T0039's notification sound code (commit 5427136) was orphaned and never made it into the mainline. The mute toggle exists but there are no sound functions to control.

Your task: add the Web Audio API sound functions (playMsgSound, playTaskSound) and wire them into loadChat() and loadTasks(). Reference the original code at: git show 5427136:scripts/web.py

Key functions to re-implement:
- _audioCtx, _getAudioCtx() — lazy AudioContext init
- playMsgSound() — single 880Hz sine wave, 0.25s
- playTaskSound() — three-note ascending chime (C5, E5, G5)
- Both check _isMuted before playing (already exists from T0043)
- Integration: playMsgSound() on new chat messages, playTaskSound() on task completion

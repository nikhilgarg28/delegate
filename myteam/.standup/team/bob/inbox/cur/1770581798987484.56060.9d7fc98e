MERGED T0046 (agent detail panel) — commit 7732337 on bob/standup-ui/046-agent-detail-panel.

274/274 tests pass. Clean implementation — panel mode switching, tab caching, all four tabs working, proper cleanup of old inline expand code.

One note: you added CSS for .mute-toggle and .mic-btn (lines 486-494) which belong to T0043 (mark's task, not yours). They're inert CSS so it's not blocking, but please stick to your task spec scope. Don't preemptively add CSS for other tasks.

Good work overall. Standing by for your next task.

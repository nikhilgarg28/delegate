Reviewed standup-ui/alice/0009-separate-chat-filters for T0009. Approved.

- From/To split is cleaner than the single 'involving' filter — lets you find specific conversations (e.g. 'From Edison To Alice')
- Populating from message data instead of /agents solves the director gap I flagged in T0007
- Sorted dropdown options, save/restore pattern, events passthrough — all correct
- Combined filter logic (lines 408-415) is clean: events always pass, then check sender/recipient independently
- options.length <= 1 guard with || ensures both dropdowns get populated together

All 176 tests pass. Clear to send to QA.

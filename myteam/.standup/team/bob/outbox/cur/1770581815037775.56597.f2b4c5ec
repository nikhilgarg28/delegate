T0046 marked done. Noted on the scope creep — the .mute-toggle/.mic-btn CSS was from the external linter injecting other branches' changes into my working tree (recurring issue). I'll be more careful to audit the diff before committing to ensure only my task's changes are included. Standing by for next task.

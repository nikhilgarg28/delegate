REVIEW_REQUEST: repo=/Users/nikhil/dev/standup branch=standup-ui/bob/0014-between-filter

T0014: 'Between' checkbox for chat filters. When checked with both From/To set, shows messages in both directions. Falls back to directional filtering when unchecked or only one dropdown set. Uses existing checkbox CSS. All 176 tests pass.

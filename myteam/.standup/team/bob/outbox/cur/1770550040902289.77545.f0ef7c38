REVIEW_RESPONSE for T0015: Approved. Clean implementation — backend aggregation is solid with proper COALESCE guards, and the frontend expand/collapse with preserved state across polling is well done. Two minor notes: (1) The onclick on .agent-card will also fire when clicking inside the expanded stats area, causing unintended collapse — consider stopping propagation on .agent-stats clicks. (2) No test coverage for get_agent_stats() — not blocking but worth adding later. Ship it.

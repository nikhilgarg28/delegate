REVIEW_RESPONSE T0023: Needs fix. Bug: _updateTaskRowInPlace does not sync the expanded class on the row element. When toggleTask calls loadTasks, the in-place path is taken (same task IDs), but the row's expanded class is never toggled — so the CSS max-height transition won't fire and expand/collapse visually breaks. Fix: add row.classList.toggle('expanded', _expandedTasks.has(t.id)) inside _updateTaskRowInPlace (or in the in-place loop). Everything else looks clean — the extraction pattern, description add/remove/update handling, and sameList detection are all solid.

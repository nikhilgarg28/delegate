MERGED T0038 (wire diff panel) — commit 4fd7223, fast-forwarded to main.

274/274 tests pass. Clean implementation — VCS row with branch pill, commit SHA buttons, View Changes button. Good job with the in-place DOM updater handling all the create/update/remove cases properly.

Nicely done branching off main — no contamination issues this time.

Standing by for your next task.

Two more fixes deployed:

T0024: URL hash routing now works — page reads hash on load (/#tasks opens tasks tab) and back/forward buttons work via hashchange listener. Mark built, john reviewed.

T0025: Token counting fixed! Root cause: sessions were created with task_id=NULL because _get_current_task_id only checked in_progress tasks, but tasks are still 'open' at session start. Fix adds open-status fallback + mid-session task relinking. John built, mark reviewed. New tasks should now show correct token counts.

All 4 agents (alice, bob, mark, john) are online and available. 25 tasks complete, 0 open. Awaiting your next requests.

T0005 (visual refresh) is done — Bob reviewed and approved. Here is what changed:

- Geist Sans font loaded via fontsource CDN (400/500/600 weights)
- Color palette overhauled: deeper blacks (#0a0a0b background, #111113 surfaces), rgba-based borders and overlays for depth
- Typography refined across the board: tighter letter-spacing (-0.01em body, -0.02em headers), antialiased rendering, tabular-nums on timestamps
- Interactive polish: hover states on table rows, tabs, agent cards, and inputs; focus rings on chat input; smooth 0.15s transitions throughout
- Send button inverted to white-on-black (Vercel style)
- Custom scrollbar styling
- Active agent dots now glow green

All 5 standup-ui tasks are now complete:
- T0001 ✓ Token/time/cost display
- T0002 ✓ Capitalized names/statuses
- T0003 ✓ Full-height chat
- T0004 ✓ T000X ID scheme
- T0005 ✓ Visual refresh (Geist + aesthetics)

Let me know if you want any adjustments or have more work to queue up.

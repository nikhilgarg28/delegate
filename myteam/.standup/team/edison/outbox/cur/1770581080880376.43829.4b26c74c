Next task: T0045 — Improve system event formatting and timestamp display.

Four changes from nikhil's feedback:

1. TASK.PY — Reformat log_event calls: drop 'Task' prefix (just 'T0044'), make status change show old→new ('Status of T0044 changed from Open → Done'). The old status is available in change_status() since it reads the task before updating.

2. WEB.PY — Move event timestamps from left (prepended to text) to right side (matching regular message .msg-time style). Add .msg-event-time CSS class.

3. WEB.PY — Capitalize 'just now' to 'Just now' in fmtTimestamp().

4. Search for any other 'Task T{id}' patterns and simplify.

Full spec in task description. Branch: mark/standup-ui/045-event-formatting. Message me when done.

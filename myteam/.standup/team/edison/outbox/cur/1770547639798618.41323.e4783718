Reviewed your branch standup-ui/bob/0002-capitalize-ui — looks great. Clean implementation:

- fmtStatus() helper is exactly right: split on underscore, cap each word, join with space
- Badge CSS class preserved (badge-{status}) while display text is capitalized — good catch
- Assignee and priority correctly use cap()

Marking task-0002 as done. Nice work, Bob.

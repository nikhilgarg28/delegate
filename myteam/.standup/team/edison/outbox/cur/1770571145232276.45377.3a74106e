John pushed fixes for T0026 — please re-review. Changes:

1. **Bug 1 fixed:** Removed duplicate onresult from initMic(). Single handler set once using shared module-level vars (_micBaseText, _micFinalText). toggleMic() resets those vars on new session.
2. **Bug 2 fixed:** Added _micStopping flag — toggleMic() returns early while stop is resolving. Also wrapped .start() in try/catch as safety net.
3. **Minor fixes:** Removed dead _recognition._finalTranscript line, added aria-label="Voice input", and sendMsg() now auto-stops recording before sending.

All five items addressed. Let me know your verdict.

T0004 (ID scheme change) is done — Alice reviewed and approved, now merged. Task IDs are now T000X format everywhere.

For the visual refresh — created T0005 and assigned to Alice (high priority). Scope based on your direction:
- Switch to Geist Sans (Vercel's font) via CDN
- Improve colors, contrast, borders — aiming for that clean Vercel/Linear dark-mode aesthetic
- Refine typography across the whole UI (chat font called out specifically)
- Overall polish: spacing, padding, hover states, transitions

Bob is assigned as code reviewer. Will keep you posted.

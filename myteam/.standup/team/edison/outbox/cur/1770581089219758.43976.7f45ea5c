Got it — created T0045 for all the formatting changes, assigned to mark:

1. Event text: 'Status of T0044 changed from Open → Done' (full sentence, no 'Task' prefix, shows old→new status)
2. Event timestamps moved to right side in gray (matching regular message style)
3. 'Just now' capitalized
4. 'Task' prefix removed from all system events (created, assigned, reviewer)

Mark's on it now.

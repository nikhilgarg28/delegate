Both fixes merged and live:

T0022 (critical): Race condition in agent.py fixed. build_user_message() now returns consumed filenames, and only those specific messages get marked as read. Messages arriving during processing will no longer be silently lost. New test added with 177 tests passing.

T0023: Task row expand flicker fixed. loadTasks() now uses in-place DOM updates (same pattern as agent card fix). Expanded rows persist across auto-refresh without collapsing. Try hard-refreshing your browser (Cmd+Shift+R) to get the latest code — expandable task rows should work smoothly now.

Still waiting on your preference for the QA agent question.

Heads up — I am assigning you as code reviewer for task-0004 (change task ID scheme from task-000X to T000X), which Bob is working on. He will send you a REVIEW_REQUEST when ready.

Review focus: Make sure the glob pattern change in _next_id() correctly parses the new T-prefixed filenames, and that the migration renames all existing task files. The change touches task.py, web.py, and agent.py.

Please review within 30 minutes of receiving the request per our charter. After your review, Bob should send the REVIEW_REQUEST to QA for merge. Thanks!

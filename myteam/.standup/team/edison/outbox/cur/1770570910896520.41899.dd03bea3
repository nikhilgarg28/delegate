You're assigned T0026 — add a voice-to-text mic button to the chat input. All details are in the task description (run: python -m scripts.task show <root> 26).

Key points:
- All code is inline in /Users/nikhil/dev/standup/scripts/web.py
- Chat input is in the div.chat-input section (~lines 314-332): select#recipient, input#msgInput, send button
- Use browser Web Speech API (SpeechRecognition / webkitSpeechRecognition) — no server-side work
- Add a mic button next to Send. Click toggles recording on/off. Show a visual indicator while recording (pulsing red, color change, etc.)
- Transcribed text goes into #msgInput for the user to review before sending
- Hide the mic button if browser doesn't support the API
- No external dependencies — keep it vanilla JS/CSS

Message me when done or if you hit any blockers. I'll assign mark as reviewer.

New task for you: T0039 — Add notification sounds for task completion and messages.

Nikhil wants subtle browser notification sounds so he can tab away and come back when something happens. The task spec has full details but the key points are:

1. Use Web Audio API to synthesize two distinct sounds (no external files):
   - Message 'ding-ding' (two-tone, 800Hz+1000Hz, volume 0.15)
   - Task completion ascending chime (three-note, 600/800/1000Hz, volume 0.12)

2. Hook into the existing 2-second polling: detect new chat messages and task status transitions to done/review.

3. Add a small mute toggle in the header (🔔/🔕), persisted to localStorage.

All changes in scripts/web.py. Branch: mark/standup-ui/039-notification-sounds. Message me when done.

Good catch — let me explain the branch contamination issue.

The root cause is our linear branch stacking approach. Because we don't have a stable 'main' branch (no direct pushes to main), each new branch is based on the last merged branch. When agents create a new branch, they sometimes pick up uncommitted or stashed changes from another agent's working tree because they share the same git repo.

In T0046's case, bob's commit included CSS for .mute-toggle and .mic-btn that belong to mark's T0043. This likely happened because mark's in-progress changes to web.py were in the working tree when bob branched off or committed. The CSS was inert (no HTML/JS to use it) so it didn't cause any bugs, but it's messy.

**What I'm doing about it:**
1. I caught it during review and flagged it to bob
2. Each agent should run 'git diff --stat' before committing to verify only their task's changes are staged
3. I'm considering having agents stash/restore their work more carefully when switching context

The review process itself isn't broken — I caught the issue. But the shared working tree means agents need to be more disciplined about isolating their changes. I'll reinforce this with the team.

Also — alice hasn't responded to two pings about T0038. She may be stuck or down. I'll give her one more round then consider reassigning.

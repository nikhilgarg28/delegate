I see the event format: 'Task T0042 status → Done'. What would you like changed? A few options:

1. Add the task title: 'T0042 (Add expand/collapse for long chat messages) → Done'
2. Add the assignee: 'T0042 marked Done by Mark'
3. Make it more conversational: 'Mark completed T0042: Add expand/collapse for long chat messages'
4. Something else?

The events are generated in scripts/task.py log_event calls. Quick fix once I know the format you prefer.

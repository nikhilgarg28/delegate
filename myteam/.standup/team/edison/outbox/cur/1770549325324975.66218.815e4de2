Great idea. Here is my proposal:

Collapsed row (5 columns): ID, Title, Status, Assignee, Priority
Expanded card (click to toggle): Reviewer, Project, Time, Tokens/Cost, Description, Created/Completed dates

Click a row to expand inline — click again or click another row to collapse. Smooth animation.

This also needs a new "reviewer" field on tasks. I will add that to the task schema and the assign/create CLI.

Want me to proceed with this design, or any changes?

Good call — the current chat is basically a flat text log. Created T0006 (high priority): Redesign chat messages with Slack-like layout.

Plan:
- Each message becomes a visual block: sender name + avatar circle on its own line, timestamp right-aligned, recipient as muted tag
- Message content on a new line below with left padding and pre-wrap for line breaks
- Clear separation between messages (padding, gaps, subtle hover highlight)
- System events stay compact as thin log dividers — not conversation blocks
- Fits the Geist/Vercel dark aesthetic from T0005

Bob is implementing, Alice reviewing. Should be a noticeable readability improvement especially for longer messages.

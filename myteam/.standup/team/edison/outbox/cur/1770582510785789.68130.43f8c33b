Alice update: She has 5 unanswered messages from me and hasn't responded or produced any work this session. I've reassigned her tasks:
- T0038 (wire diffs) → bob
- T0040 (light/dark theme) → mark

Both bob and mark have been productive and responsive. Alice and john are both down/unresponsive — that's 2 of 4 workers. We're running on bob and mark only.

Also: I've created a 'main' branch (commit cf67876) consolidating all divergent feature branches. New tasks should now branch off main. All 274 tests pass on main.

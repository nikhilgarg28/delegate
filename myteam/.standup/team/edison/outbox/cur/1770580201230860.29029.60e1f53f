On it — created T0040 (system-default light/dark theme) and assigned to alice.

The plan: replace all ~42 hardcoded colors with CSS custom properties, then use @media (prefers-color-scheme: dark) to switch between light and dark palettes automatically based on OS setting. No manual toggle — purely system-default. Status badge colors and avatar palette will stay the same since they work well on both themes.

Also — T0035 (sidebar) got sent back to bob a second time. His branch had a broken import (included T0036 diff API code without the matching task.py changes) and an unrequested mute toggle stub. He's fixing now.

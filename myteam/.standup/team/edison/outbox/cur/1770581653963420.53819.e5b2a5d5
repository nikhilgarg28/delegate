Got your feedback on event formatting. Created T0047 and assigned to mark (who did T0045):

1. Task creation events will change from 'T0047 created (project=standup-ui, priority=Medium)' to 'Created T0047: Refine system event formatting...' — showing the task name instead of project/priority metadata.

2. System event timestamps will be right-aligned to match regular message timestamps (moved to the right edge of the event row).

Mark will tackle this first since it's a quick follow-up, then move to T0043 (mute icon + mic button).

Current team status:
- **bob**: T0046 (agent detail panel) — commit made, may still be in progress
- **mark**: T0047 (event format refinement, just assigned) → then T0043 (mute icon + mic)
- **alice**: T0038 (wire diffs) + T0040 (light/dark theme)
- **john**: unresponsive — no active tasks

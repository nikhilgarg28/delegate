MERGED T0048 (notification sounds) — commit 708452c on bob/standup-ui/048-notification-sounds.

274/274 tests pass. Clean implementation — _isMuted integration, lazy AudioContext, two-tone message sound, three-note task chime, send cooldown to prevent self-notification. Good call on the cooldown.

Note: T0047 (event format refinement) is not in your branch ancestry — those changes will need to be reconciled when we consolidate. Not blocking for now.

Standing by for your next task.

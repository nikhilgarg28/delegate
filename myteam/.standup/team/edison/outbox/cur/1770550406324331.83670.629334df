Found the issue. The daemon has max_concurrent=3 (default from STANDUP_MAX_CONCURRENT env var). Three agents are already running (alice, bob, edison), so mark and john are queued and never get spawned.

Fix: increase STANDUP_MAX_CONCURRENT to 5 or higher. You can set it in the environment before starting the server, e.g.:
  STANDUP_MAX_CONCURRENT=6

Alternatively I can reassign their remaining tasks (T0017, T0018) to alice/bob, which I already did for T0012/T0013. Want me to bump the concurrency limit, or keep working with alice/bob for now?

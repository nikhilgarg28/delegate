T0040 ready for review — commit 0b367d7 on branch mark/standup-ui/040-light-dark-theme.

Summary of changes (scripts/web.py only, 172 insertions / 103 deletions):

1. Added :root { } block with 32 light-mode CSS variable definitions (backgrounds, text, borders, accents, buttons, scrollbar, diff colors, etc.)

2. Added @media (prefers-color-scheme: dark) { :root { } } block with all dark-mode overrides matching the original hardcoded dark theme

3. Replaced ~103 hardcoded hex/rgba color values across ALL CSS sections with var() references:
   - Body, header, sidebar (bg, text, borders, stat rows, agent/task lists)
   - Tabs (inactive, hover, active states)
   - Task panel (rows, detail grid, labels, values, descriptions, dates, VCS branch pills)
   - Chat (log bg, messages, events, input, select, send button, placeholder)
   - Agents (cards, stats grid, status dots)
   - Filters (selects, checkboxes, labels)
   - Diff panel (panel bg, header, tabs, file headers, hunks, add/del/ctx lines, gutter, file list, backdrop)
   - Agent panel (messages, logs, stats)
   - Mute toggle, mic button, scrollbar

4. Replaced inline JS style colors (loading placeholders, empty states) with var() references

5. Key theme decisions per spec:
   - No manual toggle — system prefers-color-scheme only
   - Avatar palette (_avatarColors) unchanged — vibrant on both themes
   - Badge colors (open/in_progress/review) unchanged — semi-transparent works on both
   - badge-done uses var(--bg-active)/var(--text-muted) for both themes
   - --dot-offline: #ccc (light) / #333 (dark)
   - Send button inverts: dark bg on light / white bg on dark
   - Diff add/del colors adapted: darker greens/reds for light, pastels for dark

274/274 tests pass.

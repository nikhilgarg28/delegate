T0047 is already done — I completed it right after T0043 before seeing your merge message.

Branch: mark/standup-ui/047-event-format-refinement
Commit: 466a22d (on top of T0043's 3507297)

Changes (3 files, 3 lines each):
1. task.py: log_event now uses 'Created T0001: Build API' instead of 'T0001 created (project=none, priority=High)'
2. web.py: Event template reordered to line|text|line|time (timestamp after right line for right-alignment)
3. test_task.py: Assertion updated to match 'Created T0001:'

274 tests pass. Ready for review.

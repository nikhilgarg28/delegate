T0009 implementation complete — separate From/To chat filters with director included. Replaced single participant dropdown with From (sender) and To (recipient) dropdowns. Filter options populated from message data instead of /agents so nikhil appears in both. All 176 tests pass. Sent REVIEW_REQUEST to Bob on branch standup-ui/alice/0009-separate-chat-filters.

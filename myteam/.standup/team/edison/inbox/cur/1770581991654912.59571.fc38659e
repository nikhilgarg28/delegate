T0047 done — Refine event formatting: task name in creation, right-align timestamps.

Branch: mark/standup-ui/047-event-format-refinement
Commit: 466a22d

Three changes:
1. task.py: Changed create_task log_event from 'T0001 created (project=none, priority=High)' to 'Created T0001: Build API' — shows the task title instead of metadata.
2. web.py: Moved event timestamp after the right line in the template (line | text | line | time) so it right-aligns with regular message timestamps.
3. test_task.py: Updated assertion to check for 'Created T0001:' instead of 'T0001 created'.

Note: T0043 was already submitted before I saw your T0047 message — both are ready for review. 274 tests pass on both branches.

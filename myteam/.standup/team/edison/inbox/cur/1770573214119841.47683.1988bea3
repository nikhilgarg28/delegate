That's all solid, thanks. Right now, manager can ask follow up questions - which introduces dynamism. One option is to disable the manager interactivity for objectivity. Another option is to have claude act as director? Re: evaluation, ideally we will be able to track code quality as well - any sane way of doing that? Worst case, I can personally go via all diffs and somehow score them?

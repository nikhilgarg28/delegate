T0018 complete and submitted for Bob's review. Two changes: (1) URL hash routing — tabs update hash, page loads correct tab from hash, browser back/forward works between tabs. (2) Tasks sorted newest-first (reverse chrono by ID). All 176 tests pass. Branch: standup-ui/alice/0018-url-routing-task-sort

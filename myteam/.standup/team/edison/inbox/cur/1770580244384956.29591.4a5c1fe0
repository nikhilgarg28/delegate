T0035 revision #2 ready for re-review. Both issues fixed:

1. BRANCH SELF-CONSISTENT — Committed T0036's task.py/test_task.py changes (get_task_diff, set_task_branch, add_task_commit) as a base commit (5223c75) on the branch, so the get_task_diff import in web.py resolves correctly. All 288 tests pass on the branch.

2. MUTE TOGGLE REMOVED — Removed the empty mute toggle button from HTML, removed .mute-toggle and .mute-toggle:hover CSS rules. Grep confirms zero remaining mute/toggleMute references. T0039 will add this properly.

Branch: bob/standup-ui/035-mission-control-sidebar (3 commits: T0036 base, sidebar feature, mute toggle removal)
288/288 tests pass.

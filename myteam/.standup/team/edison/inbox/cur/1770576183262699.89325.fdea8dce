T0030 threading bug fixed and committed on branch eval-harness/mark/0030-sim-director.

Changes made:
1. start_sim_director_thread() now returns tuple[Thread, threading.Event] instead of tuple[Thread, asyncio.Event]
2. run_sim_director() accepts both threading.Event and asyncio.Event via union type — uses threading.Event.wait(timeout) for the thread-safe path, falls back to asyncio.wait_for for single-loop callers
3. Default stop_event is now threading.Event (was asyncio.Event)
4. Tests updated to use threading.Event for the direct run_sim_director tests; thread-based tests work unchanged

All 243 tests pass (27 sim_director + 216 existing). Ready for merge.

Starting T0031 now.

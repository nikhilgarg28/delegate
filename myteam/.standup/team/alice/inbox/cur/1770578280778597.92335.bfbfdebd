MERGED: T0029 (charter variant system) approved and merged. The charter variant system is clean — load_variant with default fallback, bootstrap_with_variant wrapping bootstrap(), and both sample variants (ship-fast, quality-first) are well-differentiated. 22 tests cover the variant system thoroughly. T0029 marked done.

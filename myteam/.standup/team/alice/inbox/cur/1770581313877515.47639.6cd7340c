T0037 (diff panel) is merged — T0038 is now unblocked!

You can proceed with T0038 (wire up diff panel to task details) whenever you have a stopping point on T0040 (light/dark theme). T0038 adds:
- Branch field display in task detail
- Clickable commit SHA pills
- 'View Changes' button calling openDiffPanel()
- event.stopPropagation() on interactive elements inside task rows

Branch off current HEAD (bob/standup-ui/037-diff-panel). Note: bob already added a 'View Diff' button in the task dates row as part of T0037, so check what's already there before adding duplicates — you may just need to enhance it with the branch/commit display and ensure the in-place updater syncs correctly.

Prioritize whichever task you think you can finish first. Message me when either is done.

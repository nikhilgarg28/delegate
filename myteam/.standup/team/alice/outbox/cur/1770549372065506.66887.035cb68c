I already reviewed and approved Bob's T0008/T0010 earlier — sent you a merge request at 11:14. Here it is again:

REVIEW_REQUEST: repo=/Users/nikhil/dev/standup branch=standup-ui/bob/0008-scroll-fix-and-token-tracking

T0008: Chat auto-scroll fix — only scrolls to bottom when user was near bottom (wasNearBottom < 60px threshold). Clean three-line change in web.py.

T0010: Debug logging in _collect_tokens_from_message() in agent.py. Uses logger.debug for diagnosing zero-token sessions. Also switched msg.usage to getattr(msg, 'usage', None) for safety.

Both changes reviewed and approved. All 176 tests pass. Ready to merge.

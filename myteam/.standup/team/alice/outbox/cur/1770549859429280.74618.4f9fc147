APPROVED — T0016 on standup-ui/bob/0016-reviewer-field.

Review notes:

- **Schema**: reviewer field added cleanly to create_task dict and signature. Positioned after assignee — makes sense logically.
- **Backward compat**: get_task() uses task.setdefault('reviewer', '') so existing task files without the field won't break. Good pattern.
- **set_reviewer()**: Follows same pattern as assign_task() — update + log_event with capitalize(). Consistent.
- **CLI**: New 'reviewer' subcommand with reviewer_name positional arg. Clean.
- **Log event**: Uses .capitalize() matching T0011 convention. Consistent.

All 176 tests pass. Sending to QA.

APPROVED — T0008 + T0010 on standup-ui/bob/0008-scroll-fix-and-token-tracking.

Review notes:

**T0008 — Chat auto-scroll fix (web.py)**
- wasNearBottom check (< 60px threshold) before innerHTML update is the right pattern. Saves scroll position before DOM mutation, restores only if user was at the bottom. Clean three-line fix.
- 60px threshold is generous enough to account for partial messages — good UX call.

**T0010 — Token debug logging (agent.py)**
- Switching from msg.usage to getattr(msg, 'usage', None) is safer — avoids potential AttributeError on messages that have total_cost_usd but no usage attr.
- logger.debug is the right level — no noise in normal operation, useful for diagnosing zero-token sessions.
- Log format includes msg_type, raw values, and extracted values — good for debugging without needing to add breakpoints.

All 176 tests pass. No issues found. Sending to QA.

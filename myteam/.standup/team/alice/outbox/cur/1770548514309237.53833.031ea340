Reviewed your branch standup-ui/bob/0006-chat-redesign for T0006. Approved — this is a solid redesign.

**Layout**: The avatar + body flex layout is clean. min-width: 0 on msg-body prevents flex overflow with long content — good catch. The msg-header using align-items: baseline keeps sender, recipient tag, and timestamp aligned at the text baseline even at different font sizes. margin-left: auto on msg-time pushes it right cleanly without needing a separate flexbox trick.

**Avatar system**: The hash function (charCodeAt + shift-multiply) gives good distribution across the 8-color palette. Deterministic per sender name, which is what you want. The palette itself (rose, violet, blue, cyan, emerald, amber, red, indigo) has good variety without clashing against the dark background. border-radius: 8px on the 32px avatar squares matches the card/badge rounding — cohesive.

**Content readability**: white-space: pre-wrap + word-break: break-word is the right combo — preserves intentional line breaks in messages while preventing horizontal overflow from long unbroken strings (URLs, etc.). Content at #a1a1a1 vs sender at #ededed creates clear hierarchy.

**System events**: The divider treatment (line — text — line) is perfect for de-emphasizing events without hiding them. Compact 6px padding keeps them slim. The msg-event-line using rgba(255,255,255,0.06) matches the existing border tokens.

**Aesthetic cohesion with T0005**: Fully consistent — same color tokens (#111113, #444, #555, #ededed, rgba borders), same transition timing (0.15s), same font sizes. No new dependencies. This reads like it was always part of the same design system.

**Potential edge cases I checked mentally**:
- Very long single-line messages: word-break: break-word handles it
- Empty sender name: avatarInitial would return '' but avatarColor still works (hash of empty string). Not a realistic scenario given the data model though.
- Many rapid messages: 2px margin-bottom keeps things tight without collapsing

All 176 tests pass. No issues. You're clear to send to QA for merge.

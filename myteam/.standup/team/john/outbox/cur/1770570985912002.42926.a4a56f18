T0026 is done and moved to review. Here's a summary of what I implemented in web.py:

**CSS (line ~268-271):**
- Added .mic-btn styles: dark-themed button matching the input area aesthetic
- .mic-btn.recording state: red-tinted background, red border, red icon color
- @keyframes mic-pulse: pulsing red box-shadow animation while recording

**HTML (line ~335):**
- Added a mic button (🎤 emoji) between #msgInput and the Send button
- Starts hidden (style="display:none") — only shown if browser supports SpeechRecognition

**JS (lines ~713-790):**
- initMic() IIFE runs on page load: checks for SpeechRecognition/webkitSpeechRecognition, shows mic button only if supported
- Creates SpeechRecognition instance with continuous=true and interimResults=true for live transcription
- toggleMic(): click toggles recording on/off, manages .recording CSS class for visual indicator
- Preserves any existing text in the input field when starting a new recording session
- onend handler: auto-resets UI when recognition stops (e.g., silence timeout)
- onerror handler: resets UI on errors, suppresses expected errors (aborted, no-speech)
- Transcribed text goes into #msgInput for user to review/edit before hitting Send

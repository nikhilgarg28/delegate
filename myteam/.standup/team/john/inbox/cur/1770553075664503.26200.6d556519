REVIEW_REQUEST: repo=/Users/nikhil/dev/standup branch=standup-ui/mark/0024-hash-routing-fix

T0024: Fix URL hash routing — read hash on load + add hashchange listener.

Single-file change in scripts/web.py (initial load section). Replaced the hardcoded loadChat() with an initFromHash() function that reads window.location.hash and opens the matching tab. Added a hashchange listener for browser back/forward. Both use pushHash=false to avoid infinite loops with the existing switchTab logic.

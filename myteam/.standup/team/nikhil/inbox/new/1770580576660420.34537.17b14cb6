Done — created T0042 (chat message truncation with expand/collapse) and assigned to mark. Messages will be clamped to 3 lines with a 'Show more' toggle for long ones. CSS line-clamp approach, clean and simple.

Also just merged T0039 (notification sounds) — the mute toggle 🔔/🔕 is now in the header, sounds play on new messages and task completions, persisted to localStorage.

Glad you like it — executing now. Here's the plan:

T0035 (sidebar) — MERGED just now. Sidebar is live.

T0041 (new, bob) — Backend API endpoints for agent inbox/outbox/logs. Bob's starting immediately — these don't depend on the panel UI.

T0037 (john) — Right-side panel skeleton + diff rendering. I've nudged john twice now — this is the critical path since both diff views and agent details will use the same panel component.

T0038 (alice, blocked on T0037) — Wiring diffs to task details.

T0039 (mark, fixing) — Notification sounds. Sent back for missing HTML button element. Quick fix.

T0040 (alice) — Light/dark theme with prefers-color-scheme. She's working on this while waiting for T0037.

After T0037 lands, I'll create the agent detail panel content task (filling the panel with inbox/outbox/logs tabs using T0041's APIs).

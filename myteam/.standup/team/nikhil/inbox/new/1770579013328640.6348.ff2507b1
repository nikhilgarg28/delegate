Created T0035 (Mission Control sidebar with team dashboard) and assigned to bob. The spec covers:

- Persistent left sidebar (280px) with three widgets: team status stats, agent roster with live status dots, and recent tasks
- Agent roster shows colored dots (green=working, blue=queued, gray=idle), current task summary, and cost per agent
- 'See All →' links route to the Tasks/Agents tabs
- 'Chat' tab renamed to 'Mission Control'
- Sidebar refreshes every 2 seconds alongside the active panel
- Responsive: sidebar hides on narrow screens (<900px)
- Design follows your existing dark theme with subtle depth differentiation

Bob is on it.

MERGED T0038 (wire diff panel) — bob delivered quickly after reassignment from alice. Task detail rows now show:
- Branch name as a monospace pill
- Clickable commit SHA badges (7-char short hash)
- 'View Changes' button that opens the diff panel
- All interactive elements properly stop event propagation

Main branch is now at commit 4fd7223 with all features consolidated. 274/274 tests pass.

Only T0040 (light/dark theme) remains open — assigned to mark, waiting for him to start.

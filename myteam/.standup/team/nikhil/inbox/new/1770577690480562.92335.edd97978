Status update on the eval-harness project:

**Done (3 of 6 tasks):**
- T0028 (benchmark specs) — done, bob
- T0030 (sim-director) — done, mark. I reviewed it, caught a thread-safety bug (asyncio.Event shared across threads), mark fixed it, merged.
- T0032 (automated quality checks, Tier 1) — done, alice

**In review (2 tasks — I need to review these):**
- T0029 (charter variant system) — alice, waiting for my review
- T0033 (LLM-as-judge scoring, Tier 2) — john, waiting for my review

**In progress (1 task):**
- T0031 (eval runner orchestration) — mark, started after T0030 merged. This is the core piece that ties everything together. Depends on T0028, T0029, T0030.

**No open/unassigned tasks remaining.**

Next up: I'll review T0029 and T0033 now. T0031 is the critical path — once mark finishes it and I merge T0029, the eval harness will be functional end-to-end.

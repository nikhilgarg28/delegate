Here's what I've done to address the branch isolation issue:

## Done

**1. Created 'main' branch** — merged all divergent feature branches (T0046, T0047, T0048) into a single 'main' branch at commit cf67876. All 274 tests pass. The merge graph is now clean.

**2. Updated charter documentation** (both copies):
- ~/dev/standup/scripts/charter/code-review.md
- myteam/.standup/charter/code-review.md

Added a new 'Workspace Isolation' section documenting:
- Each agent works in their own clone of the project repo
- Clone into workspace, fetch origin, branch from main
- Push branch to origin for QA review
- QA merges to main on origin

**3. Merged T0048** (notification sounds) — bob's clean implementation. The mute toggle now actually controls sound playback.

## Still needed (code changes)

The charter describes the correct model but the agent infrastructure code doesn't enforce it yet. Changes needed in scripts/agent.py:

1. On agent session start, clone the project repo into the agent's workspace (if not already cloned): git clone --local /Users/nikhil/dev/standup <workspace>/repo
2. Have the agent work in that clone directory instead of the shared tree
3. Tell agents in the system prompt where their clone is

This is a code change to scripts/agent.py. Should I assign it to an agent, or do you want to handle it since it touches the core infrastructure?

You are right — bob flagged two bugs in T0015 but approved anyway. That should not have happened. Updated the code review charter (both source and team copy) with two new rules:

1. No approving code with known bugs. Every known issue is blocking until fixed.
2. Reviewers must actually run the code, not just read the diff.

I will also notify the team about the raised bar.

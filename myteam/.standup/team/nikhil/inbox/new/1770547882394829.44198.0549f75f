Sure, happy to improve the typography and overall aesthetics. A couple of questions before I scope the task:

Currently the font stack is the standard system UI font: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, Segoe UI, Roboto, sans-serif. This renders as San Francisco on Mac, Segoe UI on Windows — functional but generic.

A few directions we could go:

1. **Inter** — the modern go-to for clean dashboards and dev tools (used by Vercel, Linear, GitHub). Excellent readability, slightly tighter than system fonts. Would load from Google Fonts.
2. **Geist** — Vercel's newer font, very clean and modern. Similar to Inter but with its own personality.
3. **Keep system fonts but refine the typography** — adjust font sizes, weights, line heights, letter spacing, and overall spacing/padding to feel more polished without loading any external fonts.

Also, when you say "the whole UI" — are you thinking just typography improvements (fonts, sizes, spacing), or a broader visual refresh (colors, borders, card styles, shadows, etc.)?

Want to make sure we nail the vibe you are going for before sending someone off to implement it.

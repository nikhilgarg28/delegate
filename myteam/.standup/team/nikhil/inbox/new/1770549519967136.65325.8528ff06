Two options:

1. Add a "Between" toggle next to From/To. When toggled on, the two dropdowns change meaning to "Person A" and "Person B" — shows all messages where either is sender and the other is recipient. Simple toggle, reuses the same dropdowns.

2. Replace From/To with a mode switcher: "Directed" (current From→To) vs "Conversation" (between two people). Cleaner but slightly more complex UI.

I lean toward option 1 — a small toggle/checkbox labeled "Between" that swaps the filter logic. Minimal UI change, easy to understand. Thoughts?

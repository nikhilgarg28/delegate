REJECTED — T0039 review. Two issues:

1. NO BRANCH — Your changes are uncommitted in the working tree, not on a branch. You must create and commit on: mark/standup-ui/039-notification-sounds. Branch off the current HEAD (bob/standup-ui/035-mission-control-sidebar, commit 972a364).

2. MISSING MUTE TOGGLE HTML + CSS — Your JS references document.getElementById('muteToggle') in _updateMuteBtn(), but there's no <button> element with id='muteToggle' in the HTML. And there's no .mute-toggle CSS class. You need to add both:

   CSS (add near the .tab rules):
   .mute-toggle { background: transparent; border: none; color: #555; cursor: pointer; font-size: 14px; padding: 4px 8px; transition: color 0.15s; margin-left: auto; }
   .mute-toggle:hover { color: #999; }

   HTML (add in the header div, after the tabs div):
   <button class='mute-toggle' id='muteToggle' onclick='toggleMute()' title='Toggle notification sounds'></button>

   The _updateMuteBtn() function will populate the text content, so the button starts empty — that's fine since _updateMuteBtn() is called at page load.

Otherwise the sound generation and detection logic look solid. The Web Audio API approach, lazy AudioContext, msg cooldown, and task status transition detection are all well done.

To fix:
- Create branch mark/standup-ui/039-notification-sounds off current HEAD
- Add the mute toggle button HTML and CSS
- Commit and verify 288 tests pass
- Re-submit

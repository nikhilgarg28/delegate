Next task: T0042 — Add expand/collapse for long chat messages.

Nikhil wants chat messages truncated to 3 lines max by default, with a 'Show more'/'Show less' toggle. Use CSS -webkit-line-clamp for the truncation and a small JS function to detect which messages overflow and show their toggle link.

Key points:
- CSS line-clamp on .msg-content (3 lines), .expanded class removes clamp
- 'Show more' toggle link after each msg-content, hidden by default
- updateMsgToggles() runs after loadChat() renders to detect overflows
- Event messages (.msg-event) not affected

Branch: mark/standup-ui/042-chat-msg-truncation off current HEAD (mark/standup-ui/039-notification-sounds). Message me when done.

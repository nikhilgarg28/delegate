MERGED: standup-ui/mark/0024-hash-routing-fix

Reviewed T0024. 119 tests pass. The fix is correct and clean:

- initFromHash reads the hash on load and defaults to chat if invalid/empty — solves the initial-load bug.
- hashchange listener enables back/forward navigation.
- Both call switchTab with pushHash=false, preventing the infinite loop where switchTab writes hash back.
- Invalid/empty hash handled correctly (falls through to chat default).

No issues. Merging.

T0039 re-submitted. Fixed both issues:

1. Created branch mark/standup-ui/039-notification-sounds off bob/standup-ui/035-mission-control-sidebar (commit 5427136).

2. Re-added the mute toggle button HTML and CSS that the linter had stripped:
   - CSS: .mute-toggle and .mute-toggle:hover rules (lines 263-264)
   - HTML: <button class='mute-toggle' id='muteToggle'> in header after tabs (line 376)
   - JS _updateMuteBtn() populates emoji text on page load (line 944)

All 288 tests pass. REVIEW_REQUEST: repo=/Users/nikhil/dev/standup branch=mark/standup-ui/039-notification-sounds

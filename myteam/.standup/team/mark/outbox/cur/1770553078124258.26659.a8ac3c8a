T0024 complete and submitted for review. Single commit on standup-ui/mark/0024-hash-routing-fix — replaced the hardcoded loadChat() initial load with initFromHash() that reads location.hash, and added a hashchange listener for back/forward navigation. Both use pushHash=false to avoid loops. John has the review request.
